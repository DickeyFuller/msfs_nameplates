# MSFS modified traffic nameplates

## Installation
Download the release/zip file.
Place the folder of one(!) desired variant of the nameplates in your "Community" folder.
A restart of MSFS is required to see the effect.

## Known issues
After a patch for MSFS, the sim not immediately loads the Community folder, so one or more restarts are required. This applies on all mods, not this one in particular.
MSFS patch 1.8.3.0 introduced some bug which hides details on nameplates randomly. Sometimes switching the Graphics settings for "generic" models to on/off restores the details.

## Uninstallation
Simply delete the folder from your "Community" folder.
